It is our first dog and she's the sweetest, most empathic dog I've ever seen. \n\nNever seen her angry. 2 weeks ago, we were doing our evening walk when we passed an apartment building. 2 women came out the door, yelled something at me. Our Asta turned around, gave them a big snarl and barked like I've never heard bark before. \n\nThat is when I knew that our sweet girl is willing to protect us.
