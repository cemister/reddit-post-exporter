    "body": "So glad you're okay!  Good, brave, gorgeous puppers.  Something similar happened to me too, years ago...was in my backyard when some guy walked up to my locked fence asking if he could talk to me and help me with my gardening.  I kept saying no and to get off my property or I'd call the cops but he wouldn't leave. He then started to climb over my fence. I ran in the house in a panic to get my phone and my dog (a 7 year old pittie) dashed past me and went after him.  Funny thing tho, is that as he was scrambling to get back over the fence, the stray cat that I fed and looked out for came out of nowhere and full-on attacked him.  Went Tasmania devil cyclone on his ass.  He managed to throw her off of him and ran. Cat had bruised ribs, and a claw was ripped out, but guess who's a permanent, full time spoiled house cat now?! :) Cops caught the guy cause I have security cameras, but it taught me to never underestimate any animal that loves you and considers you theirs.  My old arthritic girl and a stray alley cat went straight Rambo, and I love them both so much. \n\nGive your pups some extra cuddles...they're good logs indeed!",
