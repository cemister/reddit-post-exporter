    "body": "What good pups! I’m glad you’re all ok! I had a GSD prior to my current dog and she was the same way. I was dozing off on the couch once and she was laying on the floor next to it. She thought I was already asleep when we heard the neighbors outside on the sidewalk talking. The growl that came out of her was terrifying. In that moment I knew that she would protect me if I ever needed her to. But thankfully I never did!\n\nIt’s not just dogs though. My horse has protected me numerous times. Usually from other horses who didn’t deserve her wrath (she’s a bit jealous lol), but she’s saved me from some nasty falls, held her ground against a much higher ranking herd member who had kicked me so hard that I went down, and helped keep my new puppy safe when I took her into the pasture for the first time (different herd than the one with the kicker). It was straight out of a buddy cop movie, I swear lol. My back was to her side with the pup between us, fending off the other horses. Who in their defense were just curious and are all very sweet. But it’s comforting to know that she’s (literally) got my back!",
